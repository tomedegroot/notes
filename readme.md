#Study material

##Tips

1. Scan the cheatsheet and listen to the lecture then. Cheat sheet can give a helicopter view
2. Study the LPIC-1 book from Brunson & Walberg. It gives more complete overview of all the details. linuxacademy.com did **not** have all the information
3. Do the quizes and test exams of both linuxacademy.com and Brunson & Walberg
