#Choosing an OS#

##Windows##

1. Use proprietary applications
2. Active Directory: authorising mechanism for the Enterprise. Brother of LDAP
3. Microsoft SQL

##Apple OSX##

1. Own hardware and software
2. Tight integration within its own ecosystem
3. Security - extremely difficult to lock down and manage

##LINUX##

1. Desktop is freeing and personal
2. Server room flexibility (you don't have to use a GUI)
3. Seen everywhere in the mobile world (Android)

##GUI and CLI##

1. All 3 OS's have GUI's and CLI's
2. Linux server can by administered by CLI only without GUI overhead
3. OS X is UNIX and can be maanged via the CLI by the most part
4. Can use PowerShell to manage via CLI only, so no GUI necessary anymore.
