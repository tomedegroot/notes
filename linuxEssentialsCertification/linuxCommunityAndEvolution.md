#Linux:an introduction#

GNU ='Gnu's not UNIX'
GCC = Gnu C Compiler

#GPL = General Public License:#
* Requires that the source code remains freely available to anyone who might want it. The Linux kernel is available under the GPL. The specific versions are distributions

#Distributions#
1. Each distribution has a Linux kernel, utilities and configurations
2. A distribtion is a like an ice cream flavour. The basis of the ice cream is the same, but each have their own flavour.
3. What makes a Linux distro:
..* Linux kernel
..* Core Unix tools(e.g. GNU tools, maybe X Window System)
..* Supplemental Software(e.g. NGINX)
..* Startup scripts/service(e.g. link to a network, show login prompt)
..* Installers(e.g. YUM, APT)
4. What is right for our project?
..* System for desktop or server?
..* Does your hardware support the distribution of choice?
