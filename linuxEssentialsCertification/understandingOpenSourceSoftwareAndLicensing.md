#Understanding Open Source Software and Licensing#

##Licensing##

Copyright grants you the sole right to copy a work, such a software. Most countries are part of the Bern convention which means countries recognize each others IP law.

Trademark is used to exclusively identify the origin of a product.

Commercial and Shareware:

1. Commercial: meant to sell for a profit.
2. Shareware: same as commercial but different copyright and legal perspectives.
3. Freeware is like shareware, but always free not cost involved.
