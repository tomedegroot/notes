#The Linux File System#

File system is used to control how data is stored and retrieved on a storage device.

Requirements:

1. Data is organized and easily located
2. Data can be saved in a persistent manner
3. Data integrity is preserved
4. Data can quickly be retrieved for a user in a later point in time

It shouldn't matter if it is a hard disk, usb-stick or cloud storage.  

In reality there are more disk file systems. These disk file systems are implementations of specific file systems.

Linux has the file system hierarchy standard (FHS). This means:
1. Hierarchy to structure data. At the top is root(/).
2. Linux systems have standard where the root dir has certain sub dirs in a certain order.
