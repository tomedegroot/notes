#Hardware#

LPIC requires basic undertanding of hardware

##CPU##

Carries out the instructions of a computer program

##RAM##

Stores the data being processed and the instructions executed by the CPU(from as a running program). Each cell contain a capacitor which is either charged or not charged and can thus represent bits.

##Graphics Card##

Releaves the CPU of generating 3D graphics. Contains it own CPU.

##Motherboard and BIOS##

Hardware such as CPU and RAM is connected to the moatherboard. The moatherboard also has the connectors to connect pheripheral devices. Connects al devices. 

Also has the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)chip which contains small programs which helps the system functions, such as program for keyboard interrupts. 

##Power Supply##

Converts AC to DC.

##Hard Disk##

Stores data not currently used. Data remains stored without power, but is slower than RAM.

##Optical Drive##

For accessing optical media. Will go away for non-optical media.

##Display##

For displaying data.
