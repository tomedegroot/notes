GNU ='Gnu's not UNIX'
GCC = Gnu C Compiler

##GPL = General Public License:##
* Requires that the source code remains freely available to anyone who might want it. The Linux kernel is available under the GPL. The specific versions are distributions

##Distributions##
* Each distribution has a Linux kernel, utilities and configurations
* A distribtion is a like an ice cream flavour. The basis of the ice cream is the same, but each have their own flavour.
* What makes a Linux distro:
  * Linux kernel
  * Core Unix tools(e.g. GNU tools, maybe X Window System)
  * Supplemental Software(e.g. NGINX)
  * Startup scripts/service(e.g. link to a network, show login prompt)
  * Installers(e.g. YUM, APT)
* What is right for our project?
  * System for desktop or server?
  * Does your hardware support the distribution of choice?
