#Understanding Open Source Software and Licensing#

##Licensing##

Copyright grants you the sole right to copy a work, such a software. Most countries are part of the Bern convention which means countries recognize each others IP law.

Trademark is used to exclusively identify the origin of a product.

Commercial and Shareware:

1. Commercial: meant to sell for a profit.
2. Shareware: same as commercial but different copyright and legal perspectives.
3. Freeware is like shareware, but always free not cost involved.

##Free Software Foundation(FSF) & Open Source Initiative(OSI)##

###Free Software Foundation & General Public License(GPL)###

License used by the Linux kernel  

Free Software Foundation (FSF)
1. Founded by Richard Stallman 1985
2. Driving force behind GNU
3. ,,Free as in Speech, Not Free as in Beer" = Freedom to do what we want to do with the software, not free as in price. Four freedoms:

  1. Freedom to use software for any purpose.
  2. Freedom to examin software.
  3. Freedom to redestribute software.
  4. Freedom to redestribute your modified software.

With free software you have the right to alter software to make it do exactly what you want.

####GPL Legal Expressions####

Known as GNU GPL

Two versions:
* GPLv2
* GPLv3, closing loopholes, such as hardware restrictions

Both state that a new product derived from another product released under the GPL, the new product should also be released under the GPL. The Linux kernel is distributed under the GPL. This makes sure that the a product released under the GPL can never by 'hijacked' by a commercial party.

LGPL = Library GPL

####Open Source Initiative (OSI)####

Similar to FSF, but 'softer'. OSI coined the term 'open source'. This means:
The promise is:
1. Better quality
2. Higher reliability
3. More flexibility
4. Lower cost

The GPL license falls under the OSI umbrella. Also other licenses that full under the OSI umbrella:
1. Apache
2. MIT
3. BSD
4. FreeBSD
5. MPL2
6. NCSA
7. OpenLDAP
8. PublicDomain
9. PHP License

* These licenses give you more freedom. Example: The MIT license lets alter free software and sell it.
* The FSF **only** supports the GPL license, OCI supports way more.
* Philosophical difference between FSF and OCI is reflected in the GPL. Anything derived from a GPL work must be released under the GPL.

In short:
1. Free software code must always be available.
2. Open source means the code is free, *but* it is not restrictive in what you want to do with the code.

FOSS is a term to address software that is both Free software and Open Source Software.

Principles of OSI:
1. Permission to derive works.
2. Respect for source code integrity.
3. No discrimination against person, groups or fields of endeavor.
4. Automatic license distribution.
5. Lack of product specificity.
6. Lack of restrictions on other software.
7. Technology neutrality.

Number 1-3 are the most important!

####Creative Commons (CC)####
1. Enable free distribution of otherwise copyrighted work
2. CC License is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use and build upon a work they have created.
3. Gives author flexibility; for example to restrict the use of the work for non-commercial use only.

FSF & OSI is dedicated for software. CC is broader, such as audio, text etc.

Major open source licenses are:
1. BSD (allows modifications to be distributed under other licenses)
2. MIT 
3. Apache (permits redistribution under the same or other license)
4. Artistic (the license is optional)
5. NPL (reserves some rights)
6. MPL

Remember: if you modify software and want to distribute it, you need to know which license to use.

One distro has many applications and comes with many different licenses.

##Open Source Business Models##

How can a company make a profit if it's product is available for free on the internet?

1. Services and support (Training, game is free but the server is not, etc.)
2. Dual licensing: one free product and one paid product with more features.
3. Multiple products: open source product is free, but other product lines are not.
4. Open source drivers: a driver is not open sourced by a vendor since it would reveal details about the product the company doesn't want to share it.
5. Bounties, company builds a feature for which is a bounty set by someone else.
6. Donations

Open Source licensing can be complex, but it affects how software evolves over time.
