#How It Works

Important to remember:

* Start with the [Linux Essentials Course](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/38)
* Download and read the required reading for a course **before taking the exam**
* [Nuggets](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/nuggets) are pieces of information that don't fit within a course
* One-on-one help available via the [Community menu option](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/community)
