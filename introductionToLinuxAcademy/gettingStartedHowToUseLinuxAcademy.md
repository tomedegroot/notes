#How It Works

Important to remember:

* Start with the [Linux Essentials Course](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/38)
* Download and read the required reading for a course **before taking the exam**
* [Nuggets](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/nuggets) are pieces of information that don't fit within a course
* One-on-one help available via the [Community menu option](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/community)

#Server Lab

* Set the server region as close to your location
* Choose the distribution that fits the specific course
* If you don't start the server for 20 days, the server will be deleted
* It might take up to 30 seconds after starting the server before you can login via the IP-address
* It is possible to mount to devices via the server dashboard
* The server role you assign is just for your own administration
* Within some exercises, it is possible to evaluate the status of your lab server
