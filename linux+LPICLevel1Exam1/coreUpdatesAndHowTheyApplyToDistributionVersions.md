##init systems

1.sysvinit was the old init system. This is now replaced per distribution:
  1. Debian/Ubuntu: Upstart (partly replaced sysvinit)
  2. RedHat: [SystemD](https://linuxacademy.com/blog/linux/centos-7-take-the-plunge-into-systemd/). Notes:
    1. parts are backwards compatible
    2. there are no longer runlevels
3. You need to know all the init systems. 
4. systemd is more important than upstart.
5. All the old stuff you learn is still required material
6. Comptia checks the linuxacademy.com material to make sure all of the content is covered:
  1. Memorize the study guide
  2. Do the quizes per section
  3. Do the practice exam
